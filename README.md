# Welcome to the Jupyter Notebook - Quantum Computing in Statistical Physics!
This is the Jupyter Notebook accompanying the paper *Introducing Quantum Computing into Statistical Physics: Random Walks and the Ising Model with Qiskit* written by Zihan Li, Irina Mazilu, and Dan Mazilu from Washington and Lee University, Physics and Engineering Department.  
This Jupyter Notebook is designed for an introductory-level quantum computing class. We first use a 'quantum coin' to introduce the concept of a qubit, and its difference from a classical bit. Next, we move on to the Random Walk model, simulating the position of a 'drunk man'. This simple model demonstrates how huge the difference 
between classical simulations and quantum simulations could be, as well as the potential of quantum computing in studying both physics models, such as the Brownian motion, and fields outside of physics, such as quantitative finance.  
At last, we present a case study with the classical Ising model. Along with presenting quantum circuits, we want the students to experience the workflow of physics research: identifying problems, writing solutions, and optimizing solutions iteratively. The optimized circuit in the Notebook looks like:

We hope both the instructors and students can have fun walking through this Jupyter Notebook and learning quantum Computing!
